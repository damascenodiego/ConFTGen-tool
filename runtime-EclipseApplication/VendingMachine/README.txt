Do NOT rename files or change file directory! (Alpha version)

Checking feature conditions on the model requires the z3 application to be executable!
Check on properties whether it has the permission to do so.

.smt2 files are temporary 

xxx.ffsm files are the FFSM model
xxx.xml files are the correspondent feature model
